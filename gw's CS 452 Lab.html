<h2>CS 452 Program 3<br>
Resource Manager<br>
</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<h3>Overview</h3>
The purpose of this programming assignment is to reinforce your
understanding of the role of the operating system as a resource
manager. &nbsp;To do this, you will implement a simulation that tracks
system state and utilizes a deadlock detection protocol.<br>
<h3><br>
</h3>
<h3>Activities</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Develop a&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span>program that simulates an operating system functioning
as a resource manager.<br>
  </li>
  <li>This is to be an <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">individual </span>programming
assignment.</li>
  <li>Submit your <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">well-documented</span>
source code and sample runs/snapshots.&nbsp; Be prepared to demonstrate
your program.</li>

<h3>Programming Assignment (Deadlock-Detection Resource Manager)<br>
</h3>
The primary task of a resource manager is the efficient and correct
allocation of resources.&nbsp; To do this properly, the manager must be
completely informed as to the current state of the system -- processes,
resources available, what resources does each process own, what resource does each process
want.&nbsp; This requires some sort of dynamic internal represenation
of the resource allocation graph described in your
textbook (see Section 5.11 on Deadlocks).<br>
<br>
Given complete knowledge of the current state of the system, it should
be possible for a resource manager to
conduct an evaluation of the system.&nbsp; Obviously, a request for a
resource that is currently being used cannot be granted, and the
requesting process must be delayed.&nbsp; However, sometimes a process
is not merely delayed, but deadlocked; and the resource manager should
be able to detect this problem and either produce diagnostic output or
take corrective measures.&nbsp; This suggests the need for some type of
deadlock detection protocol, such as a cycle-detection algorithm.<br>
<br>
The goal of this assignment is to create a resource manager and
simulate the activity of the manager in response to changing run-time
conditions.&nbsp; The system you will model has multiple processes,
multiple resource types, but only a
single instance of each resource class (this makes it easier to detect deadlock).<br>
<br>
The input file(s) <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;"></span>posted on
the course info page have the following format:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Processes:&nbsp; an integer representing the total number of
processes in the system</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Resources:&nbsp; an integer representing the total number of
resource classes in the system.&nbsp; There is one instance of each
resource type.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Resource request: the name of a process and the name of
the resource it is requesting</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Resource release: the name of a process and the name of
the resource it is releasing</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
The first two values (processes, resources) should be used to
initialize your system.&nbsp; The remaining lines in the input file
consist of resource
requests/releases that represent the activity of the various processes&nbsp;in the
system over time.&nbsp; At each resource request, your program should display the
activity taken as a result of the request (e.g. "P2 now owns R3"), and
output the result of a deadlock detection check (e.g. "System is
deadlocked: processes P1, P2").<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Output</span><br>
<br>
An additional requirement is that your program must graphically display
output.<br>
<ul>
  <li>you are already maintaining some sort of internal representation
of
system state in the form of a resource allocation graph.&nbsp; Display
the graph.</li>
  <li>the graph should change dynamically in response to changes in
system state (e.g. requests, allocations, releases, deadlocks).<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Guidelines</span>:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>this is a <span style="font-weight: bold;">simulation </span>--
you may use any language on any platform<br>
  </li>
  <li>you may modify the format<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>of
the input files as desired<br>
  </li>
  <li>be sure to incorporate informative/diagnostic output into your
program</li><li>it is recommended that you create a <span style="font-weight: bold;">multi-file</span>
solution. &nbsp;Most sophisticated programs consist of multiple files
(usually written by different developers). &nbsp;They are built
(compiled) and work together to implement a solution.</li><ul><li>recall
the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm, or the Model-View-Presenter
(MVP) pattern. &nbsp;The suggested approach is to completely de-couple
your internal representation and "engine" from the code that implements
the graphical display.</li><li>this would be a good opportunity to practice using build tools such as <span style="font-family: monospace;">make</span> or <span style="font-family: monospace;">ant</span>, or professional environments such as Visual Studio, Eclipse, or PyQt.</li></ul>
</ul>
<h3><br>
</h3>
<h3>Possible Enhancements</h3>You must demonstrate the correct
execution of your program on the posted sample input files.
&nbsp;However, you may choose to create an additional, enhanced version
of your resource manager.
<ul>
  <li>create a <span style="font-weight: bold;">deadlock avoidance</span>
resource manager</li>
  <ul>
    <li>add <span style="font-style: italic;">a priori</span>
knowledge regarding resource usage to the initialization phase</li>
    <li>add claim edges to your resource allocation graph</li>
    <li>implement a deadlock avoidance protocol as described in class<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul></ul>
<ul><li>implement&nbsp; a <span style="font-weight: bold;">detect-and-recover</span> policy<br>
  </li><ul><li>develop a protocol for recovering from detected deadlocks (as described in class)</li></ul></ul>
